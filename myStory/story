Once upon a time, there was a monkey who resided on a berry tree which was on the banks of a river. 
In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife.
The monkey wanted to make clothes for himself using crocodile skin,
so he started to befriend the crocodile by feeding him the berries.
The berries were delicious and the crocodile liked them.
After some time the monkey started poisoning the berries.
